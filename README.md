## Overview

## The challenge

This movie quotes generator is a self-initiative project that goes from JavaScript to very interesting technologies like NodeJS, ExpressJS and Heroku. 
It doesn't require very advanced JavaScript knowledge, but some DOM manipulation tricks and reading some tutorials about the above mentioned technologies to understand what they do and how to do it.

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what)

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Responsive design (media queries)
- JavaScript
- Rest API
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- Heroku

### What I learned

This is a fun project, where I had the opportunity to go beyond an external API. I learnt about Rest APIs, how to build my own API with NodeJS and ExpressJS and how to deploy it on Heroku.
In order to document this process, I created a [tutorial](https://www.cristina-padilla.com/restapi.html) that explains the previous technologies and how to build the movie quotes generator. I hope it helps. 


Have a lot of fun building your quotes generator with your favourite movies. Happy coding! ðŸš€
